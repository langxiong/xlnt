## Introduction
xlnt is a C++14 library for reading, writing, and modifying XLSX files as described in [ECMA 376 4th edition](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm). The API is based on [openpyxl](https://bitbucket.org/openpyxl/openpyxl), a Python library to read/write Excel 2007 xlsx/xlsm files, and ultimately on [PHPExcel](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel), pure PHP library for reading and writing spreadsheet files upon which openpyxl was based. This project is still very much a work in progress, but the core development work is complete.

## Usage
Including xlnt in your project
```c++
// with -std=c++14 -Ixlnt/include -Lxlnt/lib -lxlnt
// can also use the generated "xlnt.pc" in ./build directory with pkg-config to get these flags
#include <xlnt/xlnt.hpp>
```

Creating a new spreadsheet and saving it as book1.xlsx
```c++
xlnt::workbook wb;
xlnt::worksheet ws = wb.get_active_sheet();
ws.get_cell("A1").set_value(5);
ws.get_cell("B2").set_value("string data");
ws.get_cell("C3").set_formula("=RAND()");
ws.merge_cells("C3:C4");
ws.freeze_panes("B2");
wb.save("book1.xlsx");
```

Opening an existing spreadsheet, book2.xlsx, and printing all cells
```c++
xlnt::workbook wb2;
wb2.load("book2.xlsx");

// no need to use references, "cell", "range", and "worksheet" classes are only wrappers around pointers to memory in the workbook
for(auto row : wb2["sheet2"].rows())
{
    for(auto cell : row)
    {
        std::cout << cell << std::endl;
    }
}
```

## Building
xlnt uses continous integration and passes all 200+ tests in GCC 4.9, GCC5, VS2015, and Clang (using Apple LLVM 7.0).

Build configurations for Visual Studio 2015, GNU Make, and Xcode can be created using [cmake](https://cmake.org/) and the cmake scripts in the project's cmake directory. A full list of cmake generators can be found [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-generators.7.html). A basic build would look like (starting in the root xlnt directory):

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
```

The resulting library, libxlnt.dylib or libxlnt.so or xlnt.dll, would be found in the build/lib directory. Other cmake configuration options can be found using "cmake -LH". These options include shared vs static library and whether to build tests or not. An example of building a static library with tests as an Xcode project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D TESTS=1 -D SHARED=0 -D STATIC=1 -G Xcode ..
cmake --build .
bin/xlnt.test
```

## Dependencies
xlnt uses the following libraries, which are included in the source tree (all but miniz as [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules#Cloning-a-Project-with-Submodules)) for convenience:
- [miniz v1.15_r4](https://code.google.com/p/miniz/) (public domain/unlicense)
- [libstudxml v1.1.0](http://www.codesynthesis.com/projects/libstudxml/) (MIT license)
- [utfcpp v2.3.4](http://utfcpp.sourceforge.net/) (Boost Software License, Version 1.0)
- [cxxtest v4.4](http://cxxtest.com/) (LGPLv3 license [only used for testing, separate from main library assembly])

Initialize the submodules with this command:
```bash
git submodule update --init
```
